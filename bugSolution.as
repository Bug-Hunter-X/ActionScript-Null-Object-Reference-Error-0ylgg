The corrected ActionScript code includes a check to see if `myObject` is null before accessing `someProperty`:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = null;
if (myObject != null) {
  trace(myObject.someProperty);
} else {
  trace("myObject is null. someProperty cannot be accessed.");
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for more concise code:

```actionscript
trace(myObject?.someProperty ?? "myObject or someProperty is null");
```

This approach provides a default value ("myObject or someProperty is null" in this case) if `myObject` or `someProperty` is null, preventing the runtime error.
