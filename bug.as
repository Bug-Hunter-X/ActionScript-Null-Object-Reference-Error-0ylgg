The following ActionScript code attempts to access a property of an object that is null or undefined, resulting in a runtime error:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = null;
trace(myObject.someProperty); // Error: Error #1069: Property someProperty not found on null object.
```

This is a common error, but it can be subtle and difficult to track down.  The problem lies in the fact that `myObject` is not properly initialized before accessing its property.  The code needs to handle this situation gracefully to avoid the error.
